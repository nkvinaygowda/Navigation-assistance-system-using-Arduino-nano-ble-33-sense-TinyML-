# Navigation-assistance-system-using-Arduino-nano-ble-33-sense-TinyML-
In edge technology devices, TinyML is quickly becoming as the new norm. As 
it is supplying the edge device with computational power, it aids in eliminating 
or minimizing the requirement for cloud computing, which aids in lowering 
power consumption, boosting data security, and lowering privacy hazards.
 The most common and commonly used navigation system right now is 
GPS. It is inaccurate owing to geographical considerations and climatic 
circumstances taking more energy and requiring powerful computing. It is 
challenging to integrate GPS in edge devices like AR Glasses for navigation 
applications because of the aforementioned shortcomings.
 We present a methodology and create a prototype in this mini-project, 
which is then effectively implemented in the edge device known as the Arduino 
Nano ble 33 Sense. Our major goal is to locate the image using an image 
recognition model based on TinyML. By training the photos of the path via which 
navigation must be performed, we first constructed the TinyML model, which is 
a few kilobytes in size, and then deploy it to the Edge device. Then employ voice 
commands to help the navigator.
 Last but not least, the obtained outcomes demonstrated to us that this 
TinyML-approach can be used for useful navigation applications. However, there 
are restrictions and numerous difficulties that are discussed in this mini-project 
report along with potential solutions.
